1) Packages have been renamed using the following convention:
 a) packages of the core (the ones not ending with widget.xxx)
    from:
    org.gxt.adapters.highcharts
    become:
    org.adapters.highcharts
 b) the ones strictly depending on the UI library used (gwt or gxt), namely widgets
    from:
    org.gxt.adapters.highcharts.widgets.xxx
    become:
    - for GXT:
    org.adapters.highcharts.gxt.widgets.xxx
    - for GWT:
    org.adapters.highcharts.gwt.widgets.xxx


2) Modify the .gwt.xml file replacing:
   <inherits name='org.gxt.adapters.highcharts.gxthighcharts' />
   with:
   <inherits name='org.adapters.highcharts.gxt.gxthighcharts' />
