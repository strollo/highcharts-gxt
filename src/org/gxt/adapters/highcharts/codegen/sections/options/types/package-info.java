/**
 * The parameters managed by {@link org.gxt.adapters.highcharts.widgets.HighChart} can assume all

 * The serialization is automatically managed by the library

 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This package features few additional types for convenience.
 * For example {@link org.gxt.adapters.highcharts.codegen.sections.options.types.RawStringType}
 * is used to represent string that must not be quote in serialization phase (this is useful for example
 * when expressing the rendering functions (pure javascript code).
